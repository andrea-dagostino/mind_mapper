OpenAI is a U.S. based artificial intelligence (AI) research organization founded in December 2015, researching artificial intelligence with the goal of developing "safe and beneficial" artificial general intelligence, which it defines as "highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work".[4] As one of the leading organizations of the AI Spring,[5][6][7] it has developed several large language models, advanced image generation models, and previously, released open-source models.[8][9] Its release of ChatGPT has been credited with starting the artificial intelligence spring.[10]

The organization consists of the non-profit OpenAI, Inc.[11] registered in Delaware and its for-profit subsidiary OpenAI Global, LLC.[12] It was founded by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk serving as the initial board members.[13][14][15] Microsoft provided OpenAI Global LLC with a $1 billion investment in 2019 and a $10 billion investment in 2023,[16][17] with a significant portion of the investment in the form of computational resources on Microsoft's Azure cloud service.[18]

On November 17, 2023, the board removed Altman as CEO, while Brockman was removed as chairman and then resigned as president. Four days later, both returned after negotiations with the board, and most of the board members resigned. The new initial board included former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor as chairman.[19] It was also announced that Microsoft will have a non-voting board seat.[20]

History
2015–2018: Non-profit beginnings
In December 2015, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research announced[21] the formation of OpenAI and pledged over $1 billion to the venture. The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.[12] According to an investigation led by TechCrunch, Musk was its largest donor while YC Research did not contribute anything at all.[22] The organization stated it would "freely collaborate" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public.[23][24] OpenAI is headquartered at the Pioneer Building in Mission District, San Francisco.[25][26]

According to Wired, Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the "founding fathers" of deep learning, and drew up a list of the "best researchers in the field".[27] Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015.[27] In 2016, OpenAI paid corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, but did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google.[27]

Microsoft's Peter Lee stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top NFL quarterback prospect.[27] OpenAI's potential and mission drew these researchers to the firm; a Google employee said he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI "partly because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission."[27] Brockman stated that "the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way."[27] OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba stated that he turned down "borderline crazy" offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead.[27]

In April 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of "OpenAI Gym", its platform for reinforcement learning research.[28] Nvidia gifted its first DGX-1 supercomputer to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability of reducing processing time from six days to two hours.[29][30] In December 2016, OpenAI released "Universe", a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites, and other applications.[31][32][33][34]

In 2017 OpenAI spent $7.9 million, or a quarter of its functional expenses, on cloud computing alone.[35] In comparison, DeepMind's total expenses in 2017 were $442 million. In the summer of 2018, simply training OpenAI's Dota 2 bots required renting 128,000 CPUs and 256 GPUs from Google for multiple weeks.

In 2018, Musk resigned from his board seat, citing "a potential future conflict [of interest]" with his role as CEO of Tesla due to Tesla's AI development for self-driving cars.[36] Sam Altman claims that Musk believed OpenAI had fallen behind other players like Google and Musk proposed instead to take over OpenAI himself, which the board rejected. Musk subsequently left OpenAI but claimed to remain a donor, yet made no donations after his departure.[37]

In February 2019, GPT-2 was announced, which got a lot of attention for its ability to generate human-like text.[38]

2019: Transition from non-profit
In 2019, OpenAI transitioned from non-profit to "capped" for-profit, with the profit being capped at 100 times any investment.[39] According to OpenAI, the capped-profit model allows OpenAI Global LLC to legally attract investment from venture funds and, in addition, to grant employees stakes in the company.[40] Many top researchers work for Google Brain, DeepMind, or Facebook , which offer stock options that a nonprofit would be unable to.[41] Before the transition, public disclosure of the compensation of top employees at OpenAI was legally required.[42]

The company then distributed equity to its employees and partnered with Microsoft,[43] announcing an investment package of $1 billion into the company. Since then, OpenAI systems have run on an Azure-based supercomputing platform from Microsoft.[44][45][46]

OpenAI Global LLC then announced its intention to commercially license its technologies.[47] It planned to spend the $1 billion "within five years, and possibly much faster."[48] Altman has stated that even a billion dollars may turn out to be insufficient, and that the lab may ultimately need "more capital than any non-profit has ever raised" to achieve artificial general intelligence.[49]

The transition from a nonprofit to a capped-profit company was viewed with skepticism by Oren Etzioni of the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI, who agreed that wooing top researchers to a nonprofit is difficult, but stated "I disagree with the notion that a nonprofit can't compete" and pointed to successful low-budget projects by OpenAI and others. "If bigger and better funded was always better, then IBM would still be number one."

The nonprofit, OpenAI, Inc., is the sole controlling shareholder of OpenAI Global LLC, which, despite being a for-profit company, retains a formal fiduciary responsibility to OpenAI, Inc.'s nonprofit charter. A majority of OpenAI, Inc.'s board is barred from having financial stakes in OpenAI Global LLC.[40] In addition, minority members with a stake in OpenAI Global LLC are barred from certain votes due to conflict of interest.[41] Some researchers have argued that OpenAI Global LLC's switch to for-profit status is inconsistent with OpenAI's claims to be "democratizing" AI.[50]

2020–2023: ChatGPT, DALL-E, partnership with Microsoft
In 2020, OpenAI announced GPT-3, a language model trained on large internet datasets. GPT-3 is aimed at natural language answering questions, but it can also translate between languages and coherently generate improvised text. It also announced that an associated API, named simply "the API", would form the heart of its first commercial product.[51]

In 2021, OpenAI introduced DALL-E, a specialized deep learning model adept at generating complex digital images from textual descriptions, utilizing a variant of the GPT-3 architecture.[52]

In December 2022, OpenAI received widespread media coverage after launching a free preview of ChatGPT, its new AI chatbot based on GPT-3.5. According to OpenAI, the preview received over a million signups within the first five days.[53] According to anonymous sources cited by Reuters in December 2022, OpenAI Global LLC was projecting $200 million of revenue in 2023 and $1 billion in revenue in 2024.[54]

In January 2023, OpenAI Global LLC was in talks for funding that would value the company at $29 billion, double its 2021 value.[55] On January 23, 2023, Microsoft announced a new US$10 billion investment in OpenAI Global LLC over multiple years, partially needed to use Microsoft's cloud-computing service Azure.[56][57] Rumors of this deal suggested that Microsoft may receive 75% of OpenAI's profits until it secures its investment return and a 49% stake in the company.[58] The investment is believed to be a part of Microsoft's efforts to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into the Bing search engine. Google announced a similar AI application (Bard), after ChatGPT was launched, fearing that ChatGPT could threaten Google's place as a go-to source for information.[59][60]

On February 7, 2023, Microsoft announced that it was building AI technology based on the same foundation as ChatGPT into Microsoft Bing, Edge, Microsoft 365 and other products.[61]

On March 3, 2023, Reid Hoffman resigned from his board seat, citing a desire to avoid conflicts of interest with his investments in AI companies via Greylock Partners, and his co-founding of the AI startup Inflection AI. Hoffman remained on the board of Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI.[62]

On March 14, 2023, OpenAI released GPT-4, both as an API (with a waitlist) and as a feature of ChatGPT Plus.[63]

On May 22, 2023, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever posted recommendations for the governance of superintelligence.[64] They consider that superintelligence could happen within the next 10 years, allowing a "dramatically more prosperous future" and that "given the possibility of existential risk, we can't just be reactive". They propose creating an international watchdog organization similar to IAEA to oversee AI systems above a certain capability threshold, suggesting that relatively weak AI systems on the other side should not be overly regulated. They also call for more technical safety research for superintelligences, and ask for more coordination, for example through governments launching a joint project which "many current efforts become part of".[64][65]

In August 2023, it was announced that OpenAI had acquired the New York-based start-up, Global Illumination, a company that deploys AI to develop digital infrastructure and creative tools.[66]

On September 21, 2023, Microsoft began rebranding all variants of its Copilot to Microsoft Copilot, including the former Bing Chat and the Microsoft 365 Copilot.[67] This strategy was followed in December 2023 by adding the MS-Copilot to many installations of Windows 11 and Windows 10 as well as a standalone Microsoft Copilot app released for Android[68] and one released for iOS thereafter.[69]

In October 2023, Sam Altman and Peng Xiao, CEO of the Emirati AI firm G42, announced Open AI would let G42 deploy Open AI technology.[70]

On November 6, 2023, OpenAI launched GPTs, allowing individuals to create customized versions of ChatGPT for specific purposes, further expanding the possibilities of AI applications across various industries.[71] On November 14, 2023, OpenAI announced they temporarily suspended new sign-ups for ChatGPT Plus due to high demand.[72] Access for newer subscribers re-opened a month later on December 13.[73]

Brief departure of Altman and Brockman
Further information: Removal of Sam Altman from OpenAI

Co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman

Co-founder and President of OpenAI, Greg Brockman
On November 17, 2023, Sam Altman was removed as CEO based on the board (composed of Helen Toner, Ilya Sutskever, Adam D'Angelo and Tasha McCauley) citing a lack of confidence in him, with Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati taking over as interim CEO. Greg Brockman, the president of OpenAI, was removed as chairman of the board.[74][75] Brockman resigned from the company's presidency shortly after the announcement, and reported some details of the events that occurred before he left.[76][77] This was followed by the resignation of three senior OpenAI researchers: director of research and GPT-4 lead Jakub Pachocki, head of AI risk Aleksander Madry, and researcher Szymon Sidor.[78][79]

On November 18, 2023, there reportedly were talks of Altman returning to his role as CEO amid pressure placed upon the board by investors such as Microsoft and Thrive Capital, who condemned Altman's departure.[80] Although Altman himself spoke in favor of returning to OpenAI, he has stated that he was considering starting a new company and bringing former employees of OpenAI with him if talks do not work out.[81] If Altman were to return, the members of the board agreed they would "in principle" resign from the company.[82] On November 19, 2023, negotiations with Altman to return to the company failed and Murati was replaced by Emmett Shear to take over as interim CEO.[83] The board initially contacted Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei who was a former executive at OpenAI to replace Altman and proposed a merger, both offers were declined.[84]

On November 20, 2023, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced Altman and Brockman would be joining the company to lead a new research team regarding advanced AI, and state they are still committed to OpenAI despite the turn of events.[85] The partnership had not been finalized as Altman gave the board another opportunity to negotiate with him.[86] About 738 of OpenAI's 770 employees, including Murati and Sutskever, signed an open letter stating they would quit their jobs and join Microsoft if the board did not re-hire Altman as CEO and then resign.[87][88] Investors considered taking legal action against the board members in response to potential mass resignations and Altman's removal.[89] In response, OpenAI management sent an internal memo to employees stating that negotiations with Altman and the board are back in progress and will take some time.[90]

On November 21, 2023, after continued negotiations, Altman and Brockman returned to the company in their prior roles along with a reconstructed board made up of new members Bret Taylor (as chairman) and Lawrence Summers, with D'Angelo remaining.[91] On November 22, 2023, reports emerged suggesting that Sam Altman's dismissal from OpenAI may be linked to his alleged mishandling of a significant breakthrough in the organization's secretive project codenamed Q*. According to sources within OpenAI, Q* is aimed at developing AI capabilities in logical and mathematical reasoning, and reportedly involves performing math on the level of grade-school students.[92][93][94] Concerns about Altman's response to this development, specifically regarding the potential safety implications of the discovery, were reportedly raised to the company's board shortly before his firing.[95][96] On November 29, 2023, OpenAI announced that an anonymous employee from Microsoft joined the board as a non-voting member to observe the company's operations.[97]

2024–present: Public/non-profit efforts, Sora
On January 16, 2024, OpenAI announced the formation of a new Collective Alignment team that would aim to implement ideas from the public about how to ensure its models would "align to the values of humanity." The move was from its public program launched in May 2023. The company wanted the program to be considered separate from its commercial endeavors. The move came amid intense scrutiny from regulators around the world.[98] On January 18, 2024, OpenAI announced a partnership with Arizona State University, its first with a college, that would allow the institution to have complete access to ChatGPT Enterprise. ASU planned to incorporate it into courses, tutoring, and research, among other things.[99]

On February 15, 2024, OpenAI announced a text-to-video model named Sora. They currently have no plans to release it to the public.[100]
